As you have already noticed, we said goodbye to our old website after a long time of use. Because with time come a lot more technical issues, which took a lot of time and made it difficult for us to keep the website up to date.That has prompted us to delete the forum, and we are happy now to present you this blog.</description></item></channel></rss>
